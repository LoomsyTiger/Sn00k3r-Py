another attempt but this time without wasting a day setting up crap

to do
- add edge cases like respotted black, rerack, free ball, etc.
- test some scenario's and maybe write some unit tests
- use customtkinter to add a modern simple UI
    - pressing ball-icons to add points, etc.
    - show scores on screen
- run app in browser with something like Flask and host on RPi
- figure out a (light weight) way to store data on host like SQL
